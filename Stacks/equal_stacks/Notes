Change three Arrays to ArrayLists

Write Method checkHeightEquality() to check Arrays are equal height
	- Write Method calculateHeight() to calculate the height of one array
		- Loop through each array to calculate height of each.
		
While the arrays are not of equal height (using checkHeightEquality() method)
	- Write Method findHighestArray() to find the highest array
		- Reuse calculateHeight() method
		- Use IF statement to return the highest array
	- Write Method removeLastElement() to 'pop' the last element off the highest array
	
Print out the height of the array
